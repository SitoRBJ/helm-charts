# Helm charts for the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform

This repository contains Helm charts for the [StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform](https://www.stackrox.com/platform/).

These Helm charts are published here for reference. They are also available via a Helm chart server hosted
at https://charts.stackrox.io/. Use the following commands to add this server as a repository to your local
Helm setup:
```bash
$ helm repo add stackrox https://charts.stackrox.io/
```
Afterwards, you can download or install charts via `helm pull stackrox/sensor` or `helm install stackrox/central-services`.

## Charts for Central Cluster Services

The Helm chart for the StackRox Central Cluster Services is called `central-services`. This chart is only available
for versions 3.0.50.0 and above. For historical reasons, the charts for versions 3.0.50.x are published in the directory
`[3.0.50.x-central-services](./3.0.50.0-central-services)`. The charts for versions 3.0.51.0 and above will be published
in a subdirectory called `central-services` of the respective version directory.

For instructions on how to install the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform with these charts, please refer to the
[quickstart instructions](https://install.stackrox.com/docs/get-started/quick-start-helm/).

## Charts for Secured Cluster Services

After you [install StackRox Central](https://install.stackrox.com/docs/get-started/quick-start-helm/),
you can use the Helm charts for StackRox Secured Cluster Services to install Sensor, Collector, and Admission Controller.
These Helm charts can be used independent of the installation method you chose for the central cluster services.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> We publish Helm charts with every new release of the StackRox Kubernetes
> Security Platform. Make sure to use a version that matches the version of the
> StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform you've installed.

> **PLEASE NOTE**
>
> Prior to version 3.0.51.0, the Helm chart for secured cluster services for a given
> StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform version will be located in a directory
> named after the version. From version 3.0.51.0 on, the Helm chart will be
> stored in a subdirectory called `sensor/` of the version directory.

For example, to install  Sensor, Collector, and Admission Controller using Helm
charts for the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform version 3.0.50.1, view the
instructions in the
[`3.0.50.1` directory](./3.0.50.1). For version 3.0.51.0, the instructions will
